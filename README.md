### About me

I am a 3rd year ECE student. I hope to improve my skills with machine learning, programming, math, and perhaps electronics. I am currently taking classes related to those ideas. 

## Why am I on Github
I am on Github to explore and use my skills with programming. 

## To be finished
Perhaps some contacts, fun facts, and more about me. This first push was done with undue brevity as it was the first day of class.
